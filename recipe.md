2. In a bowl, whisk flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

3. Add butter to the dry mix and cut in with a pastry knife. 

4. Add the cream, milk, and chocolate chips to the flour mixture.

5. Quickly combine ingredients until a loose dough forms.

6. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead a few times until dough holds together.  Pat into a one-inch thick circle.

7. Using a pastry scraper, cut dough into 8 even triangles and place on a baking sheet.

8. Let scones set in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up.

9. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until tops are firm and scones sound hollow when tapped.  

10. Let cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before removing to a rack to finish cooling.

11. While the scones are cooling, make the glaze: mix powdered sugar, cocoa powder, milk, and vanilla until smooth

12. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled scones and let set before enjoying.
